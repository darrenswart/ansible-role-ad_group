#The Ansible module win_domain_group does not support adding users to a group.  Instead we search for the AD user object based on
#their UserPrincipalName (UPN) which is usually their email address.  Once the user object is found we add that user to the group.
#Since we are adding users from different domains than what the group is in we need to get the user oject using the cmdlet Get-ADUser.
#This appears to be the only supported method for adding users to a group in a different domain.
